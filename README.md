## VisiCal ( An Android Calculator)


#### Overview:
In this project I was able to create a calculator called "VisiCal". This calulator UI was built using Kivy. The goal of this project is to showcase the knowledge of Python, Kivi (Gui creation), and also the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. There is no database connected to the application being it's a simple calculator. Once built I was then able to create an Android Package file (APK). This is used to distribute apps on Google's Android OS. They are in zip format and typically downloaded directly to Android devices, usually via Google play.

### Architecture
